"""Browser check for issued plans (C1 and C2), on the live address, because
issuing writes to the database.

1. "Mark as issued" stores a snapshot under its own key, once. The key holds a
   document for each role, and the plan carries the date it was issued.
2. A second attempt on the same plan is refused and writes nothing.
3. Opening an issued plan shows it from the snapshot: the screens show the
   stored figures even after the data behind them changes, and the banner says
   so. A draft in the same month follows the new data, so the two differ.
4. An issued plan cannot be renamed or deleted, and editing anything drops back
   to the working plan rather than changing what was sent.

Run from the repo folder:  python tests/browser/issued_checks.py  [--libs DIR]
Screenshots are written to tests/browser/out/."""
