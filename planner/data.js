// RAC planner: the monthly ad platform data, and which months count.
//
// The app holds monthly spend and applications in window.__AVP_DATA__: the
// repo data file (rac_data.js), with any months uploaded on the Data tab laid
// over it. This file reads that data without changing it.
//
// Part months (D3). A month counts only once it is settled:
//   1. its last day is on or before the date the data was taken, and on or
//      before the data's current-through date where that is known; and
//   2. at least data_settle_days (assumptions.csv) have passed between its
//      last day and the date the data was taken, so late-recorded
//      applications are in.
// A complete month that has not yet passed the settle period is "still
// settling". A plan can choose to count such months (Setup option "Include
// months still settling", off by default); each one used is flagged.
// The date the data was taken is the upload date for Data tab months, and the
// repo file's generated date for the rest. The Data tab keeps one upload date
// for all uploaded months (the latest upload), so that date is used for each.
